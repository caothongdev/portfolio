# Public Images Folder

Place your static images here:

## Structure:
- `/images/blog/` - Blog post images
- `/images/projects/` - Project screenshots
- `/images/profile/` - Profile pictures
- `/images/og/` - Open Graph images for social media

## Best Practices:
1. Use WebP format for better compression
2. Optimize images before uploading
3. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `portfolio-homepage.webp`)
4. Keep file sizes under 500KB
5. Use appropriate dimensions (1200x630 for OG images)
